## About
The research project **Official Depicitions** collects, digitizes, describes, analyzes and publishes post cards released by the Austrian-Hungarian Empire during the First World War.
The project's primary Investigator is **Joachim Bürgschwendter**. The project is funded by the [Tiroler Wissenschaftsfonds](https://www.tirol.gv.at/bildung/wissenschaftsfonds/) and supported by the **Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities at the Austrian Academy of Sciences** [ACDH-OeAW](http://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/) by developing and hosting a dedicated web application to support:
* data curation,  
* data enrichment (linking to normdata-records),
* data analyzes/visualization,
* data publication,
* as well as data retrieval.

The application is developed by [Peter Andorfer](http://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/en/andorfer).

## Data policy

The project's data consist of two parts, the digitized post-cards and the collected and structured metadata of the post cards. The later will made public available under a cc-by license after Jocahim Bürgschwendter defended his PhD-Thesis which is partly based upon the findings of this projects. As far as the digitzied images are concerned we plan to publish them as well if we manage to figure out the if we are actually allowed to do so.
